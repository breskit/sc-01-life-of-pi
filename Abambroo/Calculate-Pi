how to calculate pi:

consider the diameter of a circle is 1

pi is ratio of diameter to circumference.

split circle up into many segments (eg 360)

consider each segment a triangle

two sides (a & b) are length 0.5 each. Angle (C) is 360/no of segments
calculate the other length (c).

c² = a² + b² - 2ab cos C

multiply the length (c) by the number of segments (eg 360).

The more segments you have the nearer to pi you will get.
